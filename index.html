            <h1>All About Tennis</h1>
                <p>Welcome! The text of this page was gratefully borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis" title="Tennis article on Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a></p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).<br>
                    Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.<br>
                    The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point,<br>
                    while the opposite player will.<br><br>
                    
                    Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.<br>
                    The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet<br>
                    and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.<br><br> 
                   
                    The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the <br>
                    adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, <br>
                    which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.<br><br> 
                    
                    Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular:<br>
                    the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts. 
                        </p>
            <h2>Origins of the Game</h2>
                <p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of<br>
                    <i lang=”fr”>jeu de paume</i> ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style.<br>
                    Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across<br>
                    royal palaces all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of<br>
                    either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <br><br>
                    It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!",an interjection<br>
                    used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. <br>
                    Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.<br><br>
                    Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game <em>pelota</em>,<br>
                    which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham in England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.<br>
                    <strong>This is where "lawn tennis" was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time.</strong><br><br>
                    In <em>Tennis: A Cultural History</em>, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield)<br>
                    had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year and a half”. In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called <i lang=”el”>sphairistikè”</i> meaning<br>
                    "ball-playing" in Greek), and was soon known simply as "sticky" – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales.<br>
                    According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, <strong>"Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."<br>
                    </strong> According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets,<br>
                    balls for playing the game – and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections<br>
                    with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874."[ The world's <strong>oldest annual tennis tournament</strong><br>
                    took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877.<br><br> 
                    On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) in<br>
                    order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport,<br>
                    Rhode Island. The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia. Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships dates<br>
                    to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. <strong>Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open,<br>
                    and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis.</strong> Together these four events are called the Majors or <em>Slams</em><br>
                    (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball).<br><br>
                    
                    In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.<br>
                    Once a player turned pro he or she was no longer permitted to compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. In 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money<br>
                    under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their<br>
                    living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights,<br>
                    <strong>tennis's popularity has spread worldwide.</strong></p>            
            <h2>Equipment</h2>
                <p>Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Racquets</h3>
                        <p>The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds<br>
                            a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut.<br>
                            Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics,<br>
                            and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology<br>
                            led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.<br><br>
                            Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines:<br><br></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.</li>
                            <li>The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches (74 cm) in length and 12.5 inches (32 cm) in width.</li>
                            <li>The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.</li>
                            <li>The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are some of the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist.The same companies<br>
                            sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public. 
                            </p>
                    <h3>Balls</h3>
                        <p>Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating.<br>
                           Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to<br>
                           certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41–68.58 mm (2.575–2.700 in).<br>
                           Balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 g (1.98 and 2.10 oz). Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls has remained<br>
                           virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region.<br>
                           Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.
                            </p>
                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3> 
                        <p>Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized<br>
                            with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well.<br>
                            Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.
