            <h1>All About Tennis</h1>
                <p>Welcome! The text of this page was gratefully borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis" title="Tennis article on Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a></p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).<br>
                    Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.<br>
                    The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point,<br>
                    while the opposite player will.<br><br>
                    
                    Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.<br>
                    The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet<br>
                    and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.<br><br> 
                   
                    The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the <br>
                    adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, <br>
                    which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.<br><br> 
                    
                    Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular:<br>
                    the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts. 
                        </p>
            <h2>Origins of the Game</h2>
                <p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of<br>
                    <i>jeu de paume</i> ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style.<br>
                    Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across<br>
                    royal palaces all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of<br>
                    either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <br><br>
                    It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!",an interjection<br>
                    used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. <br>
                    Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.<br><br>
                    Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game <em>pelota</em>,<br>
                    which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham in England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.<br>
                    <strong>This is where "lawn tennis" was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time.</strong><br><br>
                    In <em>Tennis: A Cultural History</em>, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield)<br>
                    had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year and a half”. In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called <i>sphairistikè</i> meaning<br>
                    "ball-playing" in Greek), and was soon known simply as "sticky" – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales.<br>
                    According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, <strong>"Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."<br>
                    </strong> According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets,<br>
                    balls for playing the game – and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections<br>
                    with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." The world's <strong>oldest annual tennis tournament</strong><br>
                    took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold<br>
                    its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877.<br><br> 
                    On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) in<br>
                    order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport,<br>
                    Rhode Island. The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia. Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships dates<br>
                    to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. <strong>Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open,<br>
                    and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis.</strong> Together these four events are called the Majors or <em>Slams</em><br>
                    (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball).<br><br>
                    
                    In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.<br>
                    Once a player turned pro he or she was no longer permitted to compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. In 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money<br>
                    under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their<br>
                    living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights,<br>
                    <strong>tennis's popularity has spread worldwide.</strong></p>            
            <h2>Equipment</h2>
                <p>Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Racquets</h3>
                        <p>The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds<br>
                            a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut.<br>
                            Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics,<br>
                            and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology<br>
                            led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.<br><br>
                            Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines:<br><br></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.</li>
                            <li>The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr> (74 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) in length and 12.5 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr> (32 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) in width.</li>
                            <li>The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.</li>
                            <li>The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are some of the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist.The same companies<br>
                            sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public. 
                            </p>
                    <h3>Balls</h3>
                        <p>Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating.<br>
                           Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to<br>
                           certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41–68.58 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr> (2.575–2.700 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>).<br>
                           Balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 <abbr title="grams">g</abbr> (1.98 and 2.10 <abbr title="ounces">oz</abbr>). Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls has remained<br>
                           virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region.<br>
                           Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.
                            </p>
                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3> 
                        <p>Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized<br>
                            with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well.<br>
                            Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear. 
                            </p>    
            <h2>Manner of Play</h2> 
                            <h3>Courts</h3>
                                <p>Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) long, and 27 feet (8.2 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) wide for singles matches and 36 <abbr title="meters">ft</abbr><br>
                                   (11 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court,<br>
                                   parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than 0.8 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (1⁄3 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>). The net is 3 feet 6 inches<br>
                                   (1.07 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) high in the center. The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net,<br>
                                    3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) outside the singles court on each side.<br><br>
                                    The modern tennis court owes its design to <strong>Major Walter Clopton Wingfield.</strong> In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (<i>sphairistike</i>). <br>
                                    This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle.<br><br>
                                    Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. Grass, clay, and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet<br>
                                    is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found. 
                                    </p>
            <h2>Scoring</h2>
                           <h3>Game</h3>
                                    <p>A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points<br>
                                    more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "<i>love</i>", "<i>15</i>", "<i>30</i>", and "<i>40</i>", respectively.<br>
                                    If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40–40", but rather as "<i>deuce</i>".<br>
                                    If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead. <br>
                                    During informal games, "advantage" can also be called "ad in" or "van in" when the serving player is ahead, and "ad out" or "van out" when the receiving player is ahead.<br><br> 
                                    The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., "<i>15-love</i>")<br>
                                    after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score. </p>
                            <h3>Set</h3>
                                        <p>A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending with the first person to reach six games and at least two games more than<br>
                                           the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5.<br>
                                           If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more<br>
                                           game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. A "love" set means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a 'bagel' in the US. In tournament play,<br>
                                           the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. "6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5". <br></p>
                            <h3>Match</h3>
                                        <p>A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches<br>
                                           at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches<br>
                                           at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match. Only in the final sets of matches at the<br>
                                           Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympic Games, Davis Cup (until 2015), and Fed Cup are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely<br>
                                           until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches. In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with<br>
                                           the well-known phrase "<i>Game, set, match</i>" followed by the winning person's or team's name.</p>
            <h2>Shots</h2>
                            <h3>Serve</h3> 
                                        <p>A serve (or, more formally, a "<i>service</i>") in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the<br>
                                            apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity.<br>
                                            If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a "let" and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in.<br>
                                            There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get<br>
                                            one more try to get the serve in the box. If they miss their second serve, they lose the point.<br><br>
                                            Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve,<br>
                                            topspin serve, slice serve, and kick serve. Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with<br>
                                            their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an "<em>ace</em>". 
                                            </p>
                            <h3>Forehand</h3>
                                        <p>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side<br>
                                            of the body. There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the <i>continental</i>, the <i>eastern</i>,<br>
                                            the <i>semi-western</i>, and the <i>western</i>. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players<br>
                                            with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players.<br>
                                            Players such as Monica Seles or France's Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.</p>
                            <h3>Backhand</h3>
                                        <p>For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right<br>
                                            side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the<br>
                                            backhand was performed with one hand, using either an <i>eastern</i> or a <i>continental</i> grip. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as Björn Borg, Chris Evert,<br>
                                            Jimmy Connors, and later Mats Wilander and Marat Safin used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players, including Rafael Nadal and Serena<br>
                                            Williams. Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with<br>
                                            the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto<br>
                                            the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles,<br>
                                            use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.</p>
                            <h3>Other Shots</h3>
                                        <p>A <i>volley</i> is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball<br>
                                             into an open area of the opponent's court. The <i>half volley</i> is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally in the vicinity of the net, and played with the<br>
                                             racket close to the ground. The <i>swinging volley</i> is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it<br>
                                             returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley.<br><br> 
                                             From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the <i>lob</i> can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the<br>
                                             lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near<br>
                                             the net may then hit an <i>overhead smash</i>, a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.<br><br> 
                                             If an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected <i>drop shot</i>, by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to<br>
                                             retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to "skid" upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards<br>
                                             towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return.</p>
