         <h2>Origins of the Game</h2>
            
                <p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of<br>
                    <i>jeu de paume</i> ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style.<br>
                    Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across<br>
                    royal palaces all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of<br>
                    either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <br><br>
                    It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!",an interjection<br>
                    used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. <br>
                    Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.<br><br>
                    Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game <em>pelota</em>,<br>
                    which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham in England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.<br>
                    <strong>This is where "lawn tennis" was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time.</strong><br><br>
                    In <em>Tennis: A Cultural History</em>, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield)<br>
                    had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year and a half”. In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called <i>sphairistikè</i> meaning<br>
                    "ball-playing" in Greek), and was soon known simply as "sticky" – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales.<br>
                    According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, <strong>"Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."<br>
                    </strong> According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets,<br>
                    balls for playing the game – and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections<br>
                    with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." The world's <strong>oldest annual tennis tournament</strong><br>
                    took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold<br>
                    its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877.<br><br> 
                    On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) in<br>
                    order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport,<br>
                    Rhode Island. The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia. Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships dates<br>
                    to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. <strong>Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open,<br>
                    and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis.</strong> Together these four events are called the Majors or <em>Slams</em><br>
                    (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball).<br><br>
                    
                    In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.<br>
                    Once a player turned pro he or she was no longer permitted to compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. In 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money<br>
                    under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their<br>
                    living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights,<br>
                    <strong>tennis's popularity has spread worldwide.</strong></p>
