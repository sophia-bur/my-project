                            <h3>Courts</h3>
                                <p>Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) long, and 27 feet (8.2 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) wide for singles matches and 36 <abbr title="meters">ft</abbr><br>
                                   (11 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court,<br>
                                   parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than 0.8 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (1⁄3 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>). The net is 3 feet 6 inches<br>
                                   (1.07 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) high in the center. The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net,<br>
                                    3 feet (0.91 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) outside the singles court on each side.<br><br>
                                    The modern tennis court owes its design to <strong>Major Walter Clopton Wingfield.</strong> In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (<i>sphairistike</i>). <br>
                                    This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle.<br><br>
                                    Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. Grass, clay, and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet<br>
                                    is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found.
